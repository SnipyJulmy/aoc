== Advent of Code 2022

My AOC solution with the following languages :

* scala3
* rust

=== scala3

You can run the code for any day with the following:
```scala
sbt $day$
// example
sbt day01
```

=== rust

You can run any binary defined in the Cargo.toml file with the following:

```bash
$> cargo run --bin $day$ -- ../$day$.txt
# Example
$> cargo run --bin day01 -- ../day01.txt
```
