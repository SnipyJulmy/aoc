# Advent of Code

My solutions for Advent of Code problems.

## Running the code

### Scala

You can run the code for any day with the following:
```bash
> sbt $day
# Example
> sbt day01
```

## Rust

You can run any binary defined in the Cargo.toml file with the following:

```bash
> cargo run --bin $day -- ../inputs/$day.txt
# Example
> cargo run --bin day01 -- ../inputs/day01.txt
```
